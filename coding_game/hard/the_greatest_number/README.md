# Goal
You must print the greatest number using all the characters in the input, including the ten digits 0 to 9, the minus sign - and the decimal dot ..

Beware:
* The dot alone must not end a number, at least a digit is needed. For example, 98742. is refused, write 9874.2 instead.
* Trailing and leading zeros must be removed. Write -4 instead of -4.0000 and -5.65 instead of -5.6500.
