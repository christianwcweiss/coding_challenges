# Goal
In number theory and combinatorics, an integer partition of a positive integer n is a way of expressing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition.

Write a program outputting all integer partitions of n in reverse lexicographic order. Each partition must satisfy the following conditions:

`a1 + a2 + ... + ak = n`
`a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ ak > 0`

Output all integer partitions of n in reverse lexicographic order. The integers within each partition should be separated by spaces.

# Input
* `n: int`

# Constraints
* `1 <= n <= 9`
* Only one valid answer exists.

# Output
* `List[str]`
